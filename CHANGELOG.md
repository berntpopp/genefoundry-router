# Changelog

All notable changes to genefoundry-router are documented here.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-10

### Security

- Enforce exact Host and Origin allowlists at the outer HTTP boundary, including
  health, metrics, OAuth metadata, and MCP routes.
- Package the reviewed normalized fleet baseline and compare complete tool
  definitions at startup and on polling refreshes. Enforce mode fails startup
  on changed definitions and quarantines added or changed tools during polling.
- Publish bounded drift state through health and aggregate metrics, and require
  production Host and healthcheck configuration in the supplied Compose stack.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-10

### Security

- Add router-owned backend service credentials without forwarding caller Authorization headers.
- Require the `pubtator:write` caller scope for the canonical eight state-changing PubTator
  tools, with fail-closed no-auth behavior and PII-safe denial logging.
- Ignore missing or blank backend credentials instead of emitting an empty Bearer header, and
  document router-first credential staging for outage-free backend enforcement.

### Documentation

- Add the fleet modernization execution ledger with immutable Wave 0 merge, release, and
  validation evidence and explicit pending states for later security waves.
